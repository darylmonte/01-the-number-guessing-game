# The Number Guessing Game

The computer is going to randomly select an integer from 1 to 100. The player will keep guessing until the player finds the computer's number. The computer will tell each time if the player's guess was too high or low. After the player has successfully find the secret number, it will show the number of attempts made and the round's game stats (mean, median and mode of the attempted numbers).

The computer will then show the score to beat (least number of guesses), otherwise it will say goodbye and terminates the game.
